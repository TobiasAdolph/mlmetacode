Arsenic is present in different oxidative states in the environment and enters in the food chain through soil and water. In the agricultural field, irrigation with arsenic contaminated water, that is, having a higher level of arsenic contamination on the top soil, which may affects the quality of crop production. The major crop like rice (Oryza sativa L.) requires a considerable amount of water to complete its lifecycle. Rice plants potentially accumulate arsenic, particularly inorganic arsenic (iAs) from the field, in different body parts including grains. Different transporters have been reported in assisting the accumulation of arsenic in plant cells; for example, arsenate (AsV) is absorbed with the help of phosphate transporters, and arsenite (AsIII) through nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) by the silicon transport pathway and plasma membrane intrinsic protein aquaporins. Researchers and practitioners are trying their level best to mitigate the problem of As contamination in rice. However, the solution strategies vary considerably with various factors, such as cultural practices, soil, water, and environmental/economic conditions, etc. The contemporary work on rice to explain arsenic uptake, transport, and metabolism processes at rhizosphere, may help to formulate better plans. Common agronomical practices like rain water harvesting for crop irrigation, use of natural components that help in arsenic methylation, and biotechnological approaches may explore how to reduce arsenic uptake by food crops. This review will encompass the research advances and practical agronomic strategies on arsenic contamination in rice crop."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6342332.v1": {"title": "UTILISATION OF INDIGENOUS FRUIT TREE SPECIES WITHIN THE LAKE VICTORIA BASIN, RWANDA", "description": "This study was conducted in Bugesera, Kirehe and Nyamagabe districts of Rwanda within the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) to document the available edible indigenous fruit trees (IFTs), prioritise IFTs, document the determinants for their preferences and examine local uses of the keystone IFTs. A total of 300 farmers familiar with IFTs were interviewed face to face using semi-structured questionnaires. A total of 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted. Questionnaire responses were coded, entered and analyzed using SPSS. Generated themes from qualitative data were subjected to content analysis. A total of 13 IFTs was recorded in the sampled districts. Highly prioritized IFTs were Ximenia caffra, Garcinia buchanani, Parinari curatellifolia, Pappea capensis, Anona senegalensis, Myrianthus holstii, Carisa edulis and Lannea schimperi. Age, occupation and income of the farmers significantly influenced preference of IFTs. Major uses of IFTs included food, medicine, firewood and timber. There is a need to include the preferred IFTs in the agricultural programme since they are perceived as valuable resources."}, "10.18452/15617": {"title": "Zwischen Niedermoor und Boden", "description": "The formation of gyttja soils takes place in former lakes, predominantly under aeration. This phenomenon of now terrestrial, but formerly subhydric soils (so called gyttja soils) is mainly due to artificial drainage. Their cultivation led to a secondary pedogenesis, which had an effect on their chemical and physical properties. Thus, the sustainable use of this special type of very young land (subhydric soils) is of special importance. Hence, special emphasis has to be directed towards evaluating sequential changes: formation of sediment under water -> drainage/drying -> agricultural use/pedogenesis -> degradation/devastation in order to prevent negative consequences for the environment. In Northern Europe, gyttja deposits can be found in Northern Germany, Finland, Sweden, and mainly in Poland. 13 sites in Germany and Poland with gyttja soils have been investigated. A total of 60 profiles are described in detail. For each horizon, undisturbed samples for physical (tension curves for pF 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.2, dry bulk density) and disturbed samples for chemical analysis have been taken (loss on ignition, CaCO3 content, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy). Previously not described horizons could be visually distinguished mainly by their structure. Subhydric soils have a very specific composition, which differs greatly from other soils. The amount of organic matter and CaCO3 ranges from 5 to 95 %. Almost all sediments contain a high amount of very small particles and, as a consequence, a high pore space volume of up to 90 %. The amount of the medium and micro-pores is more than 50 %. The porosity increases with the content of organic matter. As a result of pedogenesis, the porosity decreases while the volume of micro-pores increases and the volume of medium pores decreases."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6169583.v1": {"title": "imputed SNP data matrix in PLINK format", "description": "confer interaction of genes to rice salt tolerance"}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7066772.V1": {"title": "Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx", "description": "Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx"}, "10.25384/SAGE.6934166.V1": {"title": "Supplementary Table 1", "description": "Percentages of presence and strength of menace response (MeR) with three examination modes in 152 MeR examinations (mode A = standing behind the cat; mode B = standing in front of the cat; mode C = standing in front of the cat, covering the contralateral eye).

The aim of the present study was an assessment of prognostic value of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 antigen expression in canine mammary carcinomas. Expression was evaluated with computer assisted microscopic image analysis in surgically removed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples by means of immunohistochemistry. The growth fraction parameters were compared with previously described data of flow cytometric DNA analysis as well as with clinical outcome based on 24-month long postoperative observation and careful postmortem examinations. In the group of dogs which died or were euthanatized due to metastases the mean Ki-67 index value was significantly higher in comparison to the group of animals which survived the observation period without malignant process progression. Such a relation was not observed for PCNA. Both Ki-67 and PCNA index values were significantly higher in the group of dogs with neoplasms that had increased levels of cells in the S-phase. The presence of a significant correlation between the Ki-67 antigen index and the clinical course after the operation, calculated using the t-student test, with the lack of such correlation in variance analysis test suggests that it should be treated only as a prognostic marker helper. The heterogenity of staining of the cell nuclei and the lack of correlations with the clinical course in case of PCNA seems to disqualify it as a prognostic factor."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.6960359.V1": {"title": "DSC00026.JPG", "description": "very well"}}
