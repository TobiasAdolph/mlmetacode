We propose new methods for finding confidence intervals on the attributable treatment effect in such settings. The methods do not require partial interference, but instead require an identifying assumption that is similar to requiring nonnegative treatment effects. Network or spatial information can be used to customize the test statistic; in principle, this can increase power without making assumptions on the data generating process."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3788380": {"title": "Prenatal diagnosis and prevention of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women in Northern Vietnam: study protocol", "description": "Abstract Background In Vietnam, no systematic prenatal toxoplasmosis screening is in place, and only few studies have assessed the prevalence and importance of this zoonotic parasite infection. In addition, no studies have been conducted to assess the risk factors associated with toxoplasmosis. This study protocol was developed to determine the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women in Hanoi and Thai Binh, Northern Vietnam, and to evaluate the association with risk factors and congenital toxoplasmosis. The protocol was developed in a way that it could potentially evolve into a countrywide prenatal diagnosis and prevention program, with the main focus on primary prevention. Methods The collaborating gynaecologists will invite eligible pregnant women attending antenatal care for the first time to participate in the study. At first consult, information about toxoplasmosis and its prevention will be provided. All participants will be asked to fill in a questionnaire, which is designed to analyse socio-demographic and biologically plausible risk factors associated with toxoplasmosis, and blood samples will be collected to determine the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women. In case there is suspicion of a primary infection during pregnancy, the concerned women will be followed-up by the gynaecologists according to a predefined protocol. Every participant will be informed on her serological status, risk factors and prevention measures and is offered appropriate medical information and medical follow-up if required. Discussion The hypothesis is that congenital toxoplasmosis is an important but currently under-diagnosed public health problem in Vietnam. This study can strengthen sustainable control of toxoplasmosis in Vietnam, provide a protocol for prenatal diagnosis, boost overall awareness, improve the knowledge about toxoplasmosis prevention and can be essential for evidence-based health policy."}, "10.15488/930": {"title": "Invariant manifolds with boundary for jump-diffusions", "description": "publishedVersion"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3595745.v1": {"title": "Reference-free deconvolution of DNA methylation data and mediation by cell composition effects", "description": "Abstract Background Recent interest in reference-free deconvolution of DNA methylation data has led to several supervised methods, but these methods do not easily permit the interpretation of underlying cell types. Results We propose a simple method for reference-free deconvolution that provides both proportions of putative cell types defined by their underlying methylomes, the number of these constituent cell types, as well as a method for evaluating the extent to which the underlying methylomes reflect specific types of cells. We demonstrate these methods in an analysis of 23 Infinium data sets from 13 distinct data collection efforts; these empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can reasonably estimate the number of constituent types, return cell proportion estimates that demonstrate anticipated associations with underlying phenotypic data; and methylomes that reflect the underlying biology of constituent cell types. Conclusions Our methodology permits an explicit quantitation of the mediation of phenotypic associations with DNA methylation by cell composition effects. Although more work is needed to investigate functional information related to estimated methylomes, our proposed method provides a novel and useful foundation for conducting DNA methylation studies on heterogeneous tissues lacking reference data."}, "10.5282/UBM/EPUB.1505": {"title": "On the Use of Local RBF Networks to Approximate Multivalued Functions and Relations", "description": "A connectionist model made up of a combination of RBF networks is proposed; the model decomposes multivalued dependencies into local single valued functions; theory and applications are presented."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7683572": {"title": "Crazy Sequential Representations: Fill the Gaps (04)", "description": "Not available."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5995366.v1": {"title": "Additional file 1.pdf", "description": "The supplementary figures of \"Integrative methylation score to identify epigenetic modifications associated with lipid changes resulting from fenofibrate treatment in families\"."}, "10.18452/2612": {"title": "An explicit matching theorem for level zero discrete series of unit groups of p-adic simple algebras", "description": "For $A|F$ a central simple algebra over a ${\\frak p}$-adic local field the group of units $A^\\times\\cong GL_m(D_d)$ is a general linear group over a central division algebra $D_d|F$ of index $d.$ The product $n=dm$ being fixed, the Abstract Matching Theorem (AMT) implies the existence of bijective maps ${\\Cal J}\\!\\!{\\Cal L}$ between the sets of discrete series representations of the groups $A^\\times$ such that a character relation is preserved.

Its maximal level zero extended typ determines the discrete series representation uniquely (without any twist ambiguities as for the usual types) and, conversely, every level zero discrete series representation $\\Pi$ contains a maximal level zero extended type component $\\tilde\\Sigma(\\Pi)$ which is unique up to conjugacy. In order to determine how ${\\Cal J}\\!\\!{\\Cal L}$ matches the extended types we find certain regula elliptic elements where the characters of $\\tilde\\Sigma(\\Pi)$ and $\\Pi$ are the same and we compute the character values at these elements by using a version of Shintani descent which we develop in Appendix B.
