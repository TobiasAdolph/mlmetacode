This session will empower you - the people actually doing the analyses - to position the Turing Institute as a world leader in reproducible research. We will start by defining \"reproducible research\" and \"open science\" (and discuss the difference between those two). We will introduce you to the Alan Turing Institute organisation on GitHub and give a very brief overview of the benefits of the platform for version control and collaborative working. You will leave having completed your first pull request and knowing who to ask when you have questions about reproducibility at the Turing."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6152033.v1": {"title": "Democratic administration of public basic education: common dimensions and institutional arrangements shown in regulatory framework of municipal education systems", "description": "ABSTRACT This article aims to analyze a participatory framework and possible institutional arrangements, as sponsored by municipal education systems to promote democratization of the administration of public basic education. The basis comes from principles of democratic administration and participatory mechanisms established in regulatory foundations of municipal systems of the state of Santa Catarina, which were verified through documents review, in a network research, in order to map of political-institutional conditions to promote participation and democratization of educational administration. The analyses allow the highlighting of common dimensions to these conditions, as well as setup indications of institutional arrangements with the potential to reinforce democratization of public education administration, at system and at school level."}, "10.15496/publikation-6106": {"title": "Interview and interrogation methods and their effects on true and false confessions", "description": "The interviewing and interrogation of suspects can be particularly important to securing convictions against the guilty and freeing the wrongly accused. There are two general methods of questioning suspects: information-gathering and accusatorial. The information-gathering approach, used in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and elsewhere, as more generally in Western Europe, is characterized by rapport-building, truth-seeking, and active listening. The accusatorial approach, used primarily in the United States and Canada, is characterized by accusation, confrontation, psychological manipulation, and the disallowing of denials. Which method is more effective has become a hotly debated topic as the number of false confessions identified continues to rise. Our objective was to systematically and comprehensively review published and non-published, experimental and observational studies on the effectiveness of interviewing and interrogation methods. We focus on the questioning of suspects using information-gathering and accusatorial methods seeking to elicit confessions."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.6994865.V1": {"title": "PhD Thesis: Optimal exclusive breastfeeding duration: evidence of conflict and congruence in Tsimane mother-infant pairs", "description": "Dissertation submitted for PhD in December 2015 at the University of California Santa Barbara.

We present and evaluate a Genetic Algorithm to solve the HDM location- routing problem (LRP). This planning model addresses facility location, allocation of demand to facilities, and design of delivery routes, while balancing effciency and effectiveness considerations. We provide compu- tational results on benchmark LRP instances."}}
