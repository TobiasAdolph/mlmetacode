The aim of this work has been to determine the impact of the use of components made of thermoplastic recycled plastics on the life cycle assessment of a building. From an ecological point of view, suitable applications in the building industry have been identified that can influence the use of components made of thermoplastic recycled plastics, the life cycle analyses of buildings, and the associated environmental effects. In addition, possibilities have been examined for sustaining valuable fossil resources and reducing the amount of generated waste plastics. In the first phase, I undertook a precise problem determination. This included the determination of the topic background and the definition of the target of the current research. The latter guided the work presented here. During the project, I continually checked the statements made in the problem determination for their correlation of causes and effects. Work involving the subject of plastic recycling is now inevitable. With the world's growing demand for the fossil resource of petroleum and its limited production volume, prices in the future will rise significantly not only for petroleum-based fuels, but also for plastics. The sooner that the exploration and optimization of alternative recycling processes begins and that the possibilities for the application of the recycled products are perceived, the less problematic and noticeable will be the scarcity of oil. Increased environmental awareness and growing energy prices have led to the Energy Savings Regulation (EnEV) in construction. The rules underpinning this regulation are regularly increased and tightened in order to trim new buildings to minimum energy consumption during their use. The maximum savings potential is achieved with the passive house standard, during which energy is no longer consumed during the utilization phase. This is mainly attributable to an increased use of material that reduces energy losses from buildings. Nevertheless, the EnEV considers only the utilization phase of the buildings. The production phase and the disposal phase remain outside the remit of EnEV. The term cumulative energy expenditure (KEA) involves \"the totality of the primary energy-assessed effort, which may arise in connection with the production, use and disposal of an economic good (product or service).\" (VDI Guideline VDI 4600 sheet 1) The KEA, which is colloquially known as the \"gray energy\" of construction products, has not yet become part the legally required energy performance of buildings. A reduction in the total energy requirement of buildings will however only be possible when the creation and disposal phases are also included in the calculations of energy use. In addition, interest is growing in the potential environmental impacts of the buildings created. For example, the \"CO2 footprint\" is calculated for this purpose. This value, however, allows no statement to be made with respect to all environmental effects, as significantly more factors are present that may not be proportional to one another but that must be considered within an ecological balance. In the future, \"gray energy\", potential environmental impacts, and resource consumption are likely to be included in a legally binding life cycle assessment of buildings in order for them to meet the requirements of the holistic sustainability of buildings. The DGNB certificate is a good example of such a life cycle assessment, as it already contains the components mentioned above, but it is not obligatory for all buildings. The analysis carried out here on the existing research base contains a systematic categorization of the various recycled plastics based on their different properties. In addition, I have identified existing application areas and their requirements for products from recyclates. I have analyzed and compared the utilization and recycling routes of the conventional production of plastics from fossil resources by means of software and databases for life cycle analysis. The main part of the work contains an examination of comparative balances of various functional units. Components made from recycled plastic materials were compared with conventional components made of wood, metal, stone, plastic, and fiber cement with regard to their ecological environmental effects. The data thus gained were subsequently transferred to the ecological life cycle calculation of two reference buildings in order to determine the effects that thermoplastic recycled plastics can have on the environmental sustainability of buildings."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5627167.v2": {"title": "Curb cuts HC&R version", "description": "Curb cuts HC&R version"}, "10.4225/49/5aeefb0dbeeea": {"title": "Online Survey-1.pdf", "description": "A questionnaire to conduct a survey relating performance criteria investigation for Green Building projects.

These deficiencies are due to poor detailing, increasing traffic loads as well as structural damage caused by vehicles, environmental influences and material fatigue. To ensure that the bridges remain viable, it is necessary to carry out structural assessments using state-of-the-art methods and to estimate the structural performance under current and future traffic loads. When the structural capacity of these bridges is assessed using widely used, simple static models, the bridges often do not meet the requirements of the current design codes. This is due to the fact that the design actions determined from simple models are greater than the capacities calculated according to current design codes. The shear capacities of concrete box girder bridges in particular are often insufficient, because previous design codes stipulated lower design loads and allowed lower shear reinforcement ratios in the webs. As current design codes demand larger shear resistances for webs and deck slabs, elaborate and expensive strengthening measures and even partial or complete bridge renewals can become necessary. Using more detailed analyses of the design loads and the structural behaviour of the bridges, more realistic design actions and structural resistances can be obtained. It is hence possible to gain a more complete understanding of the flow of forces and the structural resistances of the bridges. Therefore, this dissertation is concerned with determining the flow of forces in single- and multi-cell concrete box girder bridges. The goal is to show that the existing bridges meet the requirements stipulated in the current design codes, so that costly rehabilitation measures can be avoided. The focus of this dissertation is on determining the shear forces in the critical sections: in the webs near the supports as well as in the areas of the deck slab close to the webs. Experience shows that existing bridges generally have sufficient bending capacities, as they usually contain a sufficient amount of flexural reinforcement and are highly prestressed. The shear forces are determined according to the traffic load model described in DIN Report 101 [35], using spatial finite element calculations with shell elements and linear-elastic material laws. The comparison of these FE results with the results obtained from a two-dimensional analysis of framed structures shows distinct differences between the two methods. The analysis of framed structures yields non-conservative results for multi-cell sections, as the shear force is assumed to be evenly distributed among the webs as the bridge bends. The 3D FE calculations, however, indicate that the shear forces flow mainly through the webs closest to the load. Subsequently, the shear forces are determined from spatial FE models with non-linear material laws for reinforced concrete and compared with the results from the previous, linear-elastic analyses. Compared with the linear-elastic approach, the non-linear calculations yield lower shear forces in the critical web sections near the central support and higher shear forces in the critical sections near the end supports. An explanation for the different results obtained from the non-linear calculations is that the areas of the deck slab close to the webs aid in resisting the shear forces in the direction of the bridge axis. On the other hand, the load paths within the bridges change significantly, causing a decrease in the inclination of the compression fields and a hence a reduction of stress in the webs. Further investigations show that due to the redistribution of the longitudinal shear forces from the webs to the slabs the existing shear resistance in the slabs is not exceeded. The effective width of the deck slab overhang for point loads is also determined in this document. It is shown that the effective width is dependent on the slab geometry as well as on the location of the point load on the deck slab overhangs. The calculated effective widths are smaller for sections close to the diaphragms than elsewhere in the span. Diagrams based on these calculations are presented; they can be used to determine the effective slab widths for sections close to the diaphragms."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.6731198.V2": {"title": "Study on the effect of model and data model surrogation on environmental simulations", "description": "This is the dataset of a computational experiment aimed to quantify the effects of the surrogations of a building model and of the data model relative to the building model on design explorations."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7687178.V2": {"title": "Heritage Impact Assessment: A case study of a Malay Traditional Timber Houses of 'Tuan Hj Hashim Itam' (Hashim Kerani) at Teluk Air Tawar Penang Malaysia", "description": "Main Purpose: 1.
