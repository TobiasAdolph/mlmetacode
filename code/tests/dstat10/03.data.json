MIF plays a pathogenic role in a number of inflammatory diseases and has been linked to tumor progression in some cancers. Previous work has demonstrated that loss of autophagy in macrophages enhances secretion of IL1 family cytokines. Here, we demonstrate that loss of autophagy, by pharmacological inhibition or siRNA silencing of Atg5, enhances MIF secretion by monocytes and macrophages. We further demonstrate that this is dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Induction of autophagy with MTOR inhibitors had no effect on MIF secretion, but amino acid starvation increased secretion. This was unaffected by Atg5 siRNA but was again dependent on mitochondrial ROS. Our data demonstrate that autophagic regulation of mitochondrial ROS plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine secretion in macrophages, with potential implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and cancers."}, "10.18154/RWTH-2016-10809": {"title": "Method for Optical Analysis of Surface Structures of Lead-Acid Battery Electrodes Using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope", "description": "Journal of the Electrochemical Society : JES 163(6), A995-A1000 (2016). doi:10.1149/2.0861606jes"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5154865.v1": {"title": "Linear free energy relationships in RNA transesterification: theoretical models to aid experimental interpretations", "description": "RNA cleavage transesterification is of fundamental reaction in biology that is catalyzed by both protein and RNA enzymes. In this work, a series of RNA transesterification model reactions with a wide range of leaving groups are investigated with density-functional calculations in an aqueous solvation environment in order to study linear free energy relationships (LFERs) and their connection to transition state structure and bonding. Overall, results obtained from the polarizable continuum solvation model with UAKS radii produce the best linear correlations and closest overall agreement with experimental results. Reactions with a poor leaving group are predicted to proceed via a stepwise mechanism with a late transition state that is rate controlling. As leaving group becomes more acidic and labile, the barriers of both early and late transition states decrease. LFERs for each transition state are computed, with the late transition state barrier showing greater sensitivity to leaving group pKa. For sufficiently enhanced leaving groups, the reaction mechanism transits to a concerted mechanism characterized by a single early transition state. Further linear relationships were derived for bond lengths and bond orders as a function of leaving group pKa and rate constant values that can be used for prediction. This work provides important benchmark linear free energy data that allows a molecular-level characterization of the structure and bonding of the transition states for this important class of phosphoryl transfer reactions. The relations reported herein can be used to aid in the interpretation of data obtained from experimental studies of non-catalytic and catalytic mechanisms."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3599201.v1": {"title": "The influence of a modified lipopolysaccharide O-antigen on the biosynthesis of xanthan in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100", "description": "Abstract Background The exopolysaccharide xanthan is a natural product which is extensively used in industry. It is a thickening agent in many fields, from oil recovery to the food sector. Xanthan is produced by the Gram negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). We analyzed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of three mutant strains of the Xcc wild type B100 to distinguish if the xanthan production can be increased when LPS biosynthesis is affected. Results The Xcc B100 O-antigen (OA) is composed of a linear main chain of rhamnose residues with N-acetylfucosamine (FucNAc) side branches at every second rhamnose. It is the major LPS constituent. The O-antigen was missing completely in the mutant strain H21012 (deficient in wxcB), since neither rhamnose nor FucNAc could be detected as part of the LPS by MALDI-TOF-MS, and only a slight amount of rhamnose and no FucNAc was found by GC analysis. The LPS of two other mutants was analyzed, Xcc H28110 (deficient in wxcK) and H20110 (wxcN). In both of them no FucNAc could be detected in the LPS fraction, while the rhamnose moieties were more abundant than in wild type LPS. The measurements were carried out by GC and confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS analyses that indicated an altered OA in which the branches are missing, while the rhamnan main chain seemed longer than in the wild type. Quantification of xanthan confirmed our hypothesis that a missing OA can lead to an increased production of the extracellular polysaccharide. About 6.3 g xanthan per g biomass were produced by the Xcc mutant H21012 (wxcB), as compared to the wild type production of approximately 5 g xanthan per g biomass. In the two mutant strains with modified OA however, Xcc H28110 (wxcK) and Xcc H20110 (wxcN), the xanthan production of 5.5 g and 5.3 g, respectively, was not significantly increased. Conclusions Mutations affecting LPS biosynthesis can be beneficial for the production of the extracellular polysaccharide xanthan. However, only complete inhibition of the OA resulted in increased xanthan production. The inhibition of the FucNAc side branches did not lead to increased production, but provoked a novel LPS phenotype. The data suggests an elongation of the linear rhamnan main chain of the LPS OA in both the Xcc H28110 (wxcK) and Xcc H20110 (wxcN) mutant strains."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5245684": {"title": "Nitrogen triiodide - Molecule of the Month December 2001 [Archived version]", "description": "This is the Molecule of the Month entry for December 2001 about nitrogen triiodide.

Contribution of individual plant species to the total PAH accumulation is based on plant biomass data. In shrub tundra communities, the highest PAH concentrations are found in Pleurozium schreberi moss due to its high biomass and ability for active PAH accumulation. This species can be used for ecological monitoring of PAHs concentrations in the tundra communities. Light PAHs are more abundant in soils, plants of both contaminated and control sites as well as in the coal. But the highest excesses of PAH content in comparison with the control values are found for the high-molecular-weight PAHs due to their minimal concentration at the control site. Research on PAH accumulation in the organs of plants has revealed that polyarenes had fallen on the shrubs surfaces from the atmosphere and get accumulated in the plant superficial tissues without further penetration. Deciduous plant species accumulate more PAHs in leaves than evergreen shrubs do. Plants of herbal life form accumulate PAHs mainly from soil."}}
