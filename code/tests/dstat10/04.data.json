We use this R and ArcInfo Macro Language (AML) scripts backing to develop a high resolution global database available at CCAFS-Climate portal (www.ccafs-climate.org) on future climate change scenarios. The data can be used for crop modeling, niche modeling, and more generally, for assessing impacts of climate change on agriculture at fine scales. The method requires monthly maximum, minimum, mean temperatures and monthly total precipitation (from which a set of bioclimatic indices were also derived). This database (with a total of 436 different scenarios, sum of 26, 31, 19 and 33 GCMs, times 4 time-slices, at 30 arc-seconds spatial resolution) complements other existing databases that also use downscaling but are only available either for a limited set of GCMs, time-slices, regions, or for variables or at coarser resolution.
