Considering the implications of such decisions for organizations and society, in this paper, we identify the seven most frequently used criteria in dismissal decisions and examine their importance for managers. We collected data through a survey among 385 managers and used the rational ranking and the multicriteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to analyze them. The results show that commitment, performance records, and trust have the greatest impact on the dismissal decision, whereas interpersonal relationship, growth potential, and professional experience are considered secondary criteria. These results contribute to extending our knowledge about dismissal decisions and showing the most relevant criteria in these choices and the relevance assigned to each of the criteria so that greater transparency can be achieved."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.4054746.v1": {"title": "Tutorial Twibbon untuk mengganti foto profil media sosial", "description": "Kampanye Twibbon dibuat oleh koordinator kampanye sebagai sarana untuk membantu sosialisasi sebuah kegiatan.

Using static and dynamic panel estimators, two key findings were identified from this research: (1) tourism to the continent is influenced by income in developed countries, prices, telecommunication infrastructure and geographical factors as well as conservation efforts and (2) the regions in Africa do not all react the same to changes in these factors."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5363440": {"title": "Kaspersky Help Number UK @0808-238-7544.pptx", "description": "We have an expert team of antivirus support at Kaspersky Helpline Number UK @0808-238-7544, who makes sure that your antivirus program works well and perform it duty with its optimum capability."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7257260.V1": {"title": "logo13.png", "description": "H96 Max Plus RK3328 4GB RAM 32GB ROM Android 8.1 4Kx2K 100M LAN 2.4G WIFI USB3.0 VP9 H.265 HDR10 TV Box Mini PC Support HD Netflix 4K Youtube Features: 1.H96 Max plus TV BOX is equipped with 4G DD3, 32G EMMC.

The financial literature points to two lines of thought related to corruption. One approach defends the existence or bestowal of benefits, and the other points to losses in the public network. An event study based on the GARCHX-in-Mean model was conducted to understand the relationship between corruption and the decrease in the level of investment, and to identify the potential impact of corruption on selected assets. The results indicate that there was a significant devaluation of the largest state-owned companies traded on the Brazilian Stock Exchange and in American Depository Receipts, leading to money laundering and a decrease in economic growth. This supports the theory of a long-term crisis due to corruption."}}
