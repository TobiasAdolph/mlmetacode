The RIAS has been recently standardized in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain. Using the standardization samples of the U.S. (n = 2,438), Danish (n = 983), German (n = 2,103), and Spanish (n = 1,933) versions of the RIAS, this study examined measurement invariance across these four language groups for a single-factor structure, an oblique two-factor structure with a verbal and nonverbal factor, and a bifactor structure with a general, a verbal, and a nonverbal factor. Single-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the oblique two-factor and bifactor structure for each language group but not the single-factor structure. The bifactor analysis revealed that the general factor accounted for the largest proportion of common variance in each language group, while the amount of variance accounted for by the two specific factors was small and their reliabilities low. Multiple-group CFA supported scalar invariance in both, the oblique two-factor and bifactor structure."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5286214.v1": {"title": "The Vanderbilt Chest Radiograph Test (VCRT)", "description": "Images used to test people on AMT - you can use these to reprogram the task using any software you would like."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5107309.v1": {"title": "Victoria West cores from The Victoria West: earliest prepared core technology in the Acheulean at Canteen Kopje and implications for the cognitive evolution of early hominids", "description": "Victoria West cores with overshot preferential removals (a, b, c) and small sized removal (d).

In order to collect data on these European Psychology publication issues, to raise awareness and to find co-operation partners, an online survey was designed. Data were collected from 11th of February till 30th of May 2008. The survey was answered by 493 persons from 24 European countries. It was possible to show that international journals play an important role to obtain information and to foster careers. European language diversity and time delay are important aspects, which should be given more consideration. Open access still lacks awareness, especially in terms of support by authors. But we found many interested in contributing to open access journals and a journal that would ease the language barrier with a broad European focus would be very welcome.
