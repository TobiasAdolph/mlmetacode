This paper aims to see whether the government increasing their involvement in science was leading to more discussion of academia on twitter, or if it was the millennials in university who are bringing science and academia to social media. Using the Altmetric data sets, the Twitter API and the Geonames API we were able to construct a starting point for our project. After getting the three countries who had the most tweets regarding scientific research papers and three countries who had the least we began to collect specific data for each country and compared them to find patterns. We observed that all of the top three countries had a very similar percentage of students in postsecondary education as well as a significant amount of federal funding. We also noticed that out of the bottom three countries they all had a drastically lower percentage rate of students. As for their federal funding Russia and India had a significantly lower budget but China had more federal funding than both United Kingdom and Germany. With this we can deduce that the relationship between how many tweets regarding scientific articles and university students is the most significant."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7047650": {"title": "Bioconjugation", "description": "Creative Peptides provides a one-stop solution for all of your peptide-drug bioconjugation needs.https://www.creative-peptides.com/services/peptide-drug-bioconjugations.html"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.4750633": {"title": "Save your Time on Online Recharge Service.", "description": "Spend your precious time on online recharge service rather than standing in bill payment queue.

Bacterial resistance has become worrying concerning the efficacy in the treatment of diseases, and because of these aspects, the objective of this study was to verify the occurrence of E. coli O157: H7 and non-O157 in the stages of cattle slaughter and to evaluate the susceptibility of these bacteria against antimicrobial action. We collected from a cattle slaughterhouse 21 samples from manipulators' hands, 21 from knives and 300 from 50 animals in six points of the flowchart. The isolation was performed using the CT-SMAC agar and characterization of serotypes by PCR. There was higher occurrence of E. coli O157: H7 (12.0%) in animals and lower prevalence of E. coli O26 (8.0%) and O113 (2.0%). E. coli O26 was present in 9.52% of the knives. The presence of E. coli non-O157 sorbitol negative was an unexpected fact due to the method of isolation. All E. coli O157: H7 isolates were sensitive to tetracycline, cefepime, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin and sulphazotrim, and 78.85% of them were resistant to cephalothin and 34.61% to ampicillin. All E. coli O26 were sensitive to cefepime, cefoxitin and sulphazotrim, and 88.23% were resistant to tetracycline and cephalothin and 82.35% to ampicillin. The antimicrobial multiresistance was observed in both serotypes. It should be, therefore, a criteria for using antimicrobial in treatments to avoid become a public health concern."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5340535.v1": {"title": "Untitled Item", "description": "Monica Nicholle Sandra Dewi Gunawan Basri better known as Sandra Dewi, is an Indonesian model and actress.

Two experiments were conducted, which evaluated broiler chickens during the growing (43 to 56 days, Experiment 1) and finishing (57 to 70 days, Experiment 2) periods. A total of 630 males chickens of the Colonial lineage were housed in 30 boxes (21 chickens/box), with shelter area and paddocks. A completely randomized design composed of five treatments and six repetitions was used. The levels of CP tested were: 17.5, 17.0, 16.5, 16.0 and 15.5%, and 17.0, 16.5, 16.0, 15.5 and 15.0% for growing and finishing periods, respectively. The performance traits, carcass and cutsyield, and meat quality were evaluated. No effect of CP levels on the performance traits was found in broilers evaluated in two periods. Lower hot and cold carcass yield, and higher b* values in chickens were observed at the levels of CP of 16.26, 16.25 and 15.81%, respectively. However, the higher b* values may be a result of the higher corn gluten concentration in the diet. When the ideal ratio between amino acids and lysine is met, it is possible to reduce the levels of dietary CPin free-range broiler chickens down to 15.5 and 15.0% in the growing and finishing periods, respectively, without leading to a decreased performance, and carcass and cutsyield."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7451975": {"title": "Soil mesofauna in consolidated land use systems: how management affects soil and litter invertebrates", "description": "ABSTRACT: Soil mesofauna consists of small invertebrates that live in the soil or litter and are sensitive to climatic conditions, management systems, plant cover and physical or chemical soil attributes. These organisms are active in the cycling of nutrients, since they fragment the organic matter hereby accelerating microbial decomposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the invertebrate community in no-tillage, conventional tillage, minimum tillage and secondary forest in regeneration to determine the relationship of mesofauna to litter, soil attributes, management and seasonality. Therefore, ten soil samples in each system and eight litter samples in no-tillage and the forest were taken over four seasons. These samples remained in Berlese extractors for seven days for quantification and identification of mesofauna. For each fauna sample, soil samples were collected for chemical analysis. Next, diversity indices and richness were calculated and multivariate analyses were used to establish relationships between the mesofauna, soil attributes and management. In the soil, mites were more abundant in the agricultural systems than in the forest, but the springtails, sensitive to low moisture and high temperature, were more abundant in the forest. Diversity and richness were higher in soil from the forest than under other systems. In no-tillage, there was a lower density of soil mesofauna, however, under this system, many invertebrates live in litter, since litter is the main food resource for them. In forest litter, we found lower invertebrate density and higher diversity than in no-tillage. Carbon, basic cations, pH, Al and V% were the attributes that best explained fauna variability in the systems."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.6944045.V1": {"title": "Artificial shading promotes growth of taro plants", "description": "ABSTRACT Taro (Colocasia esculenta) is a plant with a long crop cycle, what hinders its cultivation in properties with area limitations. The association of crops is an option for this kind of situation. However, in order to plan the cultivation using the intercropping system, it is important to define the tolerance levels of the taro plants and the period of highest sensibility to shading. This study aimed to evaluate the behavior of the 'Japanese' taro crop, regarding growth, cultivated under levels and periods of artificial shading. A split-plot randomized block design, with 13 treatments and four replications, was used. The plots consisted of four shading levels (control = full sun, 18 %, 30 % and 50 % of shade), maintained throughout the cycle or during three months, in three periods (initial = 0-3 months; intermediate = 3-6 months; final = 6-9 months). The subplot was composed of eight plant samples (60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and 270 days after planting). The shading levels increased the total and specific leaf area, leaf area and mass ratios and dry mass partition. Thus, the taro plants showed the capacity to make leaf adjustments to suit changes in light intensity. The shading intensity of 18 %, during the whole cycle or in any of the periods studied, provides a high expansion of the leaf area."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7517234": {"title": "Passive immunity transfer in calves fed with colostrum from dams with subclinical mastitis", "description": "ABSTRACT: This study evaluated the influence of intramammary infection under the passive immunity transfer in newborn calves. Holstein cows (n=13) were monitored at delivery, and milked to obtain sterile colostrum samples (n=52) for microbiological examination. The newborn calves received 6 liters of colostrum from their dams up to 12 hours after birth. Blood samples were harvested before (D0) and after (D2) colostrum feeding. The passive immune transfer was evaluated by biochemical tests, electrophoresis and leukogram. Calves were distributed according to absence (IB-) or presence (IB+) of mammary gland infection in one or more quarters. All colostrum samples (n=52) were negative for fungal culture. Eight dams (8; 61%) had bacterial growth in one or more mammary quarter. In relation to mammary gland unit, bacterial growth was observed in 21.15% (11/52) of the colostrum samples, with predominance of coagulase negative staphylococcal infections. Statistical differences were not found among variables according to the groups. According to the experimental moments, the evaluated parameters (total protein, albumin, globulins, GGT and beta and alpha electrophoretic) increased after colostrum intake. Subclinical mastitis did not influence the passive immune transfer in Holstein calves evaluated by biochemical tests, electrophoresis or leukogram."}}
