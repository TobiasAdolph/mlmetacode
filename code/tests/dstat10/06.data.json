Culture-independent methods based on sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene describe a distinct microbial community that decreases in richness and diversity with disease progression. Understanding the functional characteristics of the microbial community may aid in identifying potential therapies and may assist in management, but current methods are cumbersome. Here, we demonstrate the use of an oxidative metabolic assay as a complement to sequencing methods to describe the microbiome in the airways of patients with CF. Methods Expectorated sputum was collected from 16 CF subjects and 8 control subjects. The Biolog Gen III Microplate was used in a community-level physiological profiling (CLPP)-based assay to examine oxidative metabolic activity. 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the taxonomy and diversity of the samples. Correlations were then identified among the oxidative activity and taxonomy data. In an additional paired analysis, sputum from seven CF subjects were collected at two separate clinic visits and compared for oxidative activity, taxonomy, and diversity. Results Significant differences in oxidative metabolic activity, microbial taxonomy, and diversity were found between the CF and control sputum samples. Oxidative activity correlated positively with total genera but not with other measures of diversity or taxonomy, demonstrating that the metabolic assay complements the structural aspects of the microbiome. As expected, Pseudomonas was significantly enriched in CF samples, while Streptococcus and Prevotella were similarly abundant in both CF and control samples. Paired analysis of CF samples at separate clinic visits revealed comparable oxidative activity that correlated with similar stability in taxonomy and diversity. Conclusions The CLPP assay used in this study complements existing sequencing methods to delineate the oxidative metabolic footprint of the CF airway bacterial community. This method may be useful to study the CF microbial community over time and with changes in disease state."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5415193.v1": {"title": "A1.RAxML.ASTRAL.tre", "description": "Data set of species trees from: https://figshare.com/projects/Evaluating_fast_maximum_likelihood-based_phylogenetic_programs_using_empirical_phylogenomic_data_sets/22040"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.4010790.v1": {"title": "1_S1_L001_I2_001.fastq.gz", "description": "Index Read 2"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3636392_D4": {"title": "Additional file 8: Table S6. of The transposable element environment of human genes is associated with histone and expression changes in cancer", "description": "Most highly down-regulated TE-rich genes that are enriched for H3K27me3 in cancer condition (PDF 206 kb)"}}
