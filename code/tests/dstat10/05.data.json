It is the public transport that performs strongly in all three areas. Public transport is not only more energy efficient, socially inclusive, more equitable and space saving but also creates 2-3 times more jobs than private transport. Public Transport, therefore, is a dynamic actor in the sustainable future of cities. Transportation is the primary source of CO2 and other green house gases, contributing up to 40 % of the cities total emissions. All over the world cities have initiated measures such as increasing the share of public transport and non-motorised modes to reduce the negative impacts of urban transport. Bus Rapid Transit, a new approach in bus system operation has put urban transportation on a more sustainable path. The paper describes the experience of BRT in Latin American cities, Indian urban transport scenario, policy frame work of Government of India and the efforts made by Indian cities to put their public transport on a sustainable path."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.6852797.V2": {"title": "Modeling Climate-wise Connectivity and the Relative Conservation Priority among and within Linkages", "description": "Presentation given to North American Congress of Conservation Biology Toronto, Ontario, Canada July 24th, 2018"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3755210.v1": {"title": "Mapping transverse velocity of particles in capillary vessels by time-varying laser speckle through perturbation analyses", "description": "We propose a cross-correlation method to map the transverse velocities of particles moving in capillary vessels using full-field time-varying laser speckle technique. The mapping is achieved by a semi-random perturbation model that describes the intensity fluctuation of time-varying laser speckle signals. When passing through probing volume, moving particles encode a random perturbation into the observed laser speckle pattern. We calculate the transverse flow velocity by cross-correlating the temporal envelopes of the perturbation signals. The proposed method is experimentally verified by the use of polymer microsphere suspension in a glass capillary."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.C.3148222": {"title": "The psychology of electoral mobilization: a subtle priming experiment", "description": "In this paper we test the idea that citizens can be stimulated to vote in an election via subtle psychological processes, which have little or nothing to do with the act of voting as such. More specifically, we argue that presenting voters with stimuli that induce an active mood will increase their tendency to vote. We conducted an experiment to test our ideas. Participants were subtly primed by giving them a campaign leaflet that contained a word puzzle, which included words that are associated with either action or inaction. The results indicate that subtly primed participants in the action condition reported stronger voting intentions than those in the inaction condition. These findings suggest that individuals can indeed be stimulated (or inhibited) to vote through subtle psychological processes. We discuss the implications of our results for the study of voting behaviour as well as campaigns aimed at electoral mobilization."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6554030.v1": {"title": "Additional file 7: of Decadal stability in genetic variation and structure in the intertidal seaweed Fucus serratus (Heterokontophyta: Fucaceae)", "description": "Temporal changes.

We used a combination of species tree and phylogeographic methods to describe the spatio-temporal changes through time and across space (= species diffusion) in a clade of seven West African lizard species in the Agama agama species group. A Bayesian species tree diffusion approach was used to compare the relative rates at which species ranges changed across the landscape. We found that some species have high diffusion rates characterized by significant movement in their range location and minor changes to their overall range size, whereas other species show little movement in their range centre with an exponential increase in range size. This discrepancy between the rates that range locations shift versus change in their relative area could be linked to populations tracking their preferred habitats through time. A continuous Bayesian phylogeography approach using a relaxed random walk model was used to estimate the timing and rate of population size change and geographic diffusion in A. picticauda, the single species in the group with an extensive African distribution from Mauritania to Ethiopia. The mean dispersal rate of A. picticauda increased dramatically throughout the Pleistocene, and a Bayesian skyride analysis supports exponential population growth over this same time period. A comparison of genetic diversity across different loci and species suggests that A. lebretoni experienced a mitochondrial selective sweep that has caused a deficit of variation at this locus in relation to nuclear loci."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.3859992.V1": {"title": "9-26-WordDocumentPDF.pdf", "description": "Computational methodology for quantifying regional and global temperature changes caused by multiple concurrent processes."}}
