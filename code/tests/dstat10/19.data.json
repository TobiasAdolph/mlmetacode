A team of veteran television film cameramen, electricians, and sound engineers who worked at the BBC Television Film Studios in the 1960s and 1970s recalled various aspects of their work. Their memories were filmed using three Sony PMW-100 digital cameras and recorded using wireless microphones. The conversation was free-flowing with occasional questions and interventions from the ADAPT crew. This video is part of a series that shows how a typical television film crew went about the task of filming footage for television during the 1960s and 1970s. ADAPT (2013-8) is a European Research Council project at Royal Holloway University of London. The project studies the history of technologies in television, focussing on their everyday use in production activities. ADAPT examines what technologies were adopted and why; how they worked; and how people worked with them. As well as publishing written accounts, the project carries out 'simulations' that reunite retired equipment with the people who used to use it. Participants in these simulations explain how each machine worked and how different machines worked together as an 'array'; how they adapted the machines; and how they worked together as teams within the overall production process. www.adaptTVhistory.org.uk https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1"}, "10.14279/DEPOSITONCE-7306": {"title": "Becoming the Synthi-Fou: Stockhausen and the new keyboardism", "description": "This publication is with permission of the rights owner freely accessible due to an Alliance licence and a national licence (funded by the DFG, German Research Foundation) respectively."}, "10.17028/RD.LBORO.7146650.V2": {"title": "Olympics and Culture: Tracings, Projections and Intersections: Olympic Tea House (2018)", "description": "Olympics and Culture: Tracings, Projections and Intersections: Olympic Tea House (2018).

Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort needed to remember things in different situations. An example of it in practice is the children's party game where a tray of objects is displayed before being hidden, and then participants are asked to remember as many of the items as possible. The difficulty of this task is affected by the type and arrangement of the objects. This piece draws on two previous pieces, like you and like you (2015) and in which one thing depends on another (2016). In like you and like you, three players each have 24 sound producing objects and 24 samples that relate to them in some way (e.g. a cap gun and recording of a cannon). Players copy each other, so when one player rings a bell, the other two players must ring their bell, or play their bell sample. This sets off chains of association. In in which one thing depends on another, two players each have a set of 10 objects and 10 words. They work together to pair each of their own words with each of the other player's objects, learning, teaching and testing each other in a gamelike way. The new orchestra piece takes elements of these two pieces and scales them up for the larger ensemble. There are two cueing players who each have a set of 24 words and samples that are used to instruct the orchestra. Each cue is linked to a major or minor triad. The cueing players deliver their cues in a playful way, developing sequences and associations (for example between gun - dog - whistle). The orchestra must play the relevant pitches as quickly as possible on hearing each cue, so the resultant texture is a map of the speed of response of the individual players. The cueing players play with this situation, making it harder or simpler for the orchestra to respond correctly. The conductor also has a set of cues that initiate noise drone samples and static noise sounds from the orchestra. The piece alternates between these two cueing systems."}, "10.4225/03/5918470c3b090": {"title": "Poetry", "description": "Three poems: Lenz, the secret miracle, Outside"}}
