Using a symbolic mathematic tool, we obtain two holonomic and four nonholonomic constraint equations due to front and rear wheels of the bicycle. We show that the two holonomic constraints cannot be expressed in quartic form, hence no analytic solution for the body pitch angle, for given steer and roll angles unless the minor (crown) radius of the torus are the same for both the front and rear wheels. Applying a standard procedure for developing dynamics in robotics, we construct constrained Euler-Lagrange equations for the 4 connected rigid bodies in the Whipple-Cornell-Delft benchmark bicycle. We eliminate Lagrange multipliers, auxiliary coordinates and obtain a set of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, corresponding to the rear body roll, steer and front wheel rotation motions. The coefficients of the equations are shown to depend only on rear body roll and steer angles. Finally, we prove the dynamic equation for the benchmark bicycle is the same as that of an underactuated manipulator, which has been studied extensively in robotics."}, "10.1184/R1/6469436": {"title": "The SLIDE simulator : a design and evaluation tool for I O and interfacing strategies", "description": "technical report"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5117101.v1": {"title": "THE IMPACT OF THE METHOD OF UNDERLAY SURFACE PROCESSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEFECTS IN EPITAXIAL COMPOSITIONS IN THE COURSE OF SILICON PHOTO-TRANSDUCERS PRODUCTION", "description": "For the production of silicon photo-transducers (PhT) the acquisition of epitaxial compositions (EC) with high resistivity of working layer. One of the main parameters characterizing the quality of EC is the density of dislocation and other structural defects. Great impact on the development of defects during epitaxial growth is produced by the quality of underlay preparation before that. Multiple research of relatively thin (less than 20-30 microns) epitaxial layers demonstrated, that contamination or damages of underlay surface cause the development of defects of wrapping, counterparts, macroscopic protuberances in the growing layer. During inverted epitaxy there are no high requirements as for structural perfection of epitaxial layer as far as in PhT, produced on the basis of EC for which inverted silicon structures (ISS) serve with the working layer of mono-crystal substrate. Therefore in inverted epitaxy it is the problem of the development in the course of defects growth not in epitaxial layer, but in underlay, that becomes the major one. The processes of the development of defects in underlay in the course of growing thick (approximately 300 microns) epitaxial layer are scarcely researched by now. Scientists sustained the idea that when using dislocation-free underlays for growing in the working layer of ISS there are dislocations with the density of 103 sm-2 and more. Thus, investigation of the factors that determine the development of dislocations in underlay in the process of epitaxy, has now gained great practical value."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.4909391.v1": {"title": "ENHANCED SOLAR PV MPPT SYSTEM FOR 12V BATTERY CHARGER", "description": "Published in AJETR"}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7010381": {"title": "Master Transcript", "description": "Control System Design, Digital Communication, Digital Signal Processing, Integrated Circuit Design, Wireless Communication, Neural Network"}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7122143": {"title": "UAV multispectral", "description": "This folder included the data and processing code for manuscript \"Multispectral imaging and unmanned aerial systems for cotton plant phenotyping\" Each subfolder was orgnized as follows: crop.m -- matlab script to read uav images and seperate into plots dem.tif -- digital elevetion model of the field generated by the PhotoScan gct_crop.mat -- matlab varible scores the position of the GCT in the ortho-mosaic/dem gct_height.txt -- maunal measurement of the GCT geo.tif -- ortho-mosaic of the field generated by the PhotoScan height.txt -- manual measurement of the plant height for each plot The processing code is UAVHeight.m.

It is important to investigate the location for placement of these devices because of their considerable cost and their inverse effects on power systems if they are badly located. Locations of FACTS devices in the power system can be obtained on the basis of static and/or dynamic performance. The intended objective of the FACTS device will have a large impact on the placement of the devices. A location that is the best for one objective may be less suitable for another. This paper presents a new multi-objective placement technique of TCSC based on sensitivity analysis for: maximum relief of network loading (or congestion), power flow control, maximum reduction in active and reactive losses in a particular line, and maximum reduction in active and reactive power loss of a power network. Moreover, OPF with FACTS constraints is used to show the validity of the placement technique to relief network congestions without load curtailment."}, "10.18419/opus-3668": {"title": "A finite volume method for the solution of magnetoplasmadynamic conservation equations", "description": "A finite volume method has been developed in this work for solving the conservation equations of argon plasma flows in magnetoplasmadynamic self-field accelerators. These accelerators can be used for interplanetary spaceflight missions because of their high specific impulse and high thrust density. Calculations for different nozzle geometries show that the diffusion caused by the electron pressure drives the arc out of nozzle-type self-field accelerators and influences the arc attachment on the anode significantly. In agreement with the experiment it has been found that a primary reason for plasma instabilities at high current settings is the depletion of density and charge carriers in front of the anode because of the pinch effect. The calculated thrust data agree well with experimental values, so that the newly developed method can be used for the design and optimization of new thrusters."}}
