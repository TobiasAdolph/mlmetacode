R.H. Hooker observed that in the late nineteenth century fluctuations in English marriage rates lagged about 6 months behind fluctuations in trade, and the same may be true in this period. The chart might therefore indicate variations in prosperity over time."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5466838": {"title": "Lewis Frieman 2015 Bake Rings Rpt 3.pdf", "description": "A Geophysical Survey of Bake Rings Enclosure, Pelynt, Cornwall Lewis, J. & Frieman, C.J Southeast Kernow Archaeological Survey Report No. 3"}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6768509": {"title": "Distribution of Land Grants (30-year interval, 17th-18th c.)", "description": "The series of maps register the distribution of land grants in the town of Curitiba in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

After briefly summarizing how the phenomenon of \u2018authority\u2019 is viewed in general, this paper takes up the specific case of authority and tradition. We then consider text as a special case of tradition, and finally knowledge texts as a special case of texts. The most significant section of the paper is the second half, where we sketch out two complementary methods of constructing or representing authority in such texts, one personal and one non-personal. Ancient Greek, religious studies, theology, church history, ancient history and Chinese studies are our areas of expertise, so most of the examples we have chosen come from those fields. But our intention is to draw broad conclusions that could also apply to other traditions as well."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6554561": {"title": "Tonnage of ships involved in foreign, coastal, and fishing trade at Hampshire and Dorset ports, 1709-16", "description": "Pie charts represent the size and relative proportions of foreign, coastal, and fishing trade in 1709.
