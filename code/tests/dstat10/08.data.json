Although the source of major innovations in automation technology is from United States universities and research centers, American firms have been too slow in adopting these technologies. One of the major factors underlying this problem is the lack of an economic analysis technique specifically aimed at estimating the benefits of automation technology. This paper offers an economic analysis technique based upon the premise of increased probability of capturing the market segments through economies of scope. The paper first demonstrates the inadequacy of current economic analysis techniques to assess the benefits of automation technology, then proposes a new methodology which can be integrated to an expert system to assess the economic impact of various types of automation technology.\""}, "10.1184/R1/6607118": {"title": "MAPS : the organization of a spatial database system using imagery, terrain, and map data", "description": "Computer Science Department"}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7181951": {"title": "SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED TEAMS", "description": "Software engineering principles are brought into practice by Information Technology companies all around the world.

After estimating autocorrelation and partial coefficients, it manifests that the appropriate ARIMA models (1,1,0) for males and ARIMA (1,1,0) for females and ARIMA (1,1,0) for males and females together. Also, it has been assured that these models are good and give accurate predictions and close to the reality through statistical calculation Q. It turns out that the selected models are appropriate and good. Finally, the prediction of the rate of the dropout of the primary schools for the male and female students during the period (2007-2015) and required results were obtained by using the Genetic Algorithm through the applications (MATLAB R2013a Version: 8.1) and (GRETL 2016)."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3638897": {"title": "Treatment-seeking rates in malaria endemic countries", "description": "Abstract Background The proportion of individuals who seek treatment for fever is an important quantity in understanding access to and use of health systems, as well as for interpreting data on disease incidence from routine surveillance systems. For many malaria endemic countries (MECs), treatment-seeking information is available from national household surveys. The aim of this paper was to assemble sub-national estimates of treatment-seeking behaviours and to predict national treatment-seeking measures for all MECs lacking household survey data. Methods Data on treatment seeking for fever were obtained from Demographic and Health Surveys, Malaria Indicator Surveys and Multiple Cluster Indicator Surveys for every MEC and year that data were available. National-level social, economic and health-related variables were gathered from the World Bank as putative covariates of treatment-seeking rates. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was used to estimate treatment-seeking behaviours for countries where survey data were unavailable. Two separate models were developed to predict the proportion of fever cases that would seek treatment at (1) a public health facility or (2) from any kind of treatment provider. Results Treatment-seeking data were available for 74 MECs and modelled for the remaining 24. GAMMs found that the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care, vaccination rates, education level, government health expenditure, and GDP growth were important predictors for both categories of treatment-seeking outcomes. Treatment-seeking rates, which varied both within and among regions, revealed that public facilities were not always the primary facility type used. Conclusions Estimates of treatment-seeking rates show how health services are utilized and help correct reported malaria case numbers to obtain more accurate measures of disease burden. The assembled and modelled data demonstrated that while treatment-seeking rates have overall increased over time, access remains low in some malaria endemic regions and utilization of government services is in some areas limited."}, "10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.3": {"title": "Local Computation Algorithms (Invited Talk)", "description": "Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their entirety. However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of local computation algorithms which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits of a legal output. The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output. In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed - we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse spanning graphs."}, "10.1184/R1/6602795.V1": {"title": "A Time Efficient Delaunay Refinement Algorithm", "description": "In this paper we present a Delaunay refinement algorithm for generating good aspect ratio and optimal size triangulations.

In MSR, each construct is associated with typing and data access specification (DAS) rules, which describe under which circumstances a principal can access keys and other information. A protocol specification is completed with a description of the intruder in the style of Dolev and Yao, the wolf in the protocol world. In this paper, we show that the protocol determines the intruder: the wolf is deep within. More precisely we show that the Dolev-Yao intruder rules can be automatically reconstructed from the DAS rules, and that the DAS rules can themselves be inferred from annotated typing declarations for the various message constructors."}, "10.18419/opus-2540": {"title": "Pruning methods for relational data mining", "description": "Knowledge discovery and data mining are concerned with the discovery of valid, novel, potentially useful, and understandable patterns in data. Most data mining algorithms require that the data are represented as a single, attribute-value table. In contrast, data mining techniques that are developed within the framework of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are applicable directly to multi-relational databases. The application of ILP for data mining is also termed relational data mining. This thesis develops and investigates pruning techniques that are applicable for pattern discovery within a restricted ILP setting where all patterns describe subgroups of a fixed population of individuals. This variant of pattern discovery is also known as relational subgroup discovery. The main contribution of the thesis is an Apriori-like search algorithm for relational subgroup discovery. Formerly, Apriori-like search was applied only in attribute-value (i. e., non-relational) settings. In particular, the contributions of the thesis are (1) a formal description of subgroup discovery in the framework of ILP, (2) optimum estimates for the interestingness criteria distributional unusualness and implication intensity, (3) an extension to the well-known Apriori algorithm that allows to constrain the set of patterns searched by Apriori, (4) an ILP language bias that allows the application of an Apriori-like algorithm for relational subgroup discovery, (5) an SQL-based language bias for relational subgroup discovery via SQL queries to a relational database management system, (6) a novel approach for integrating pruning based on structured attributes in an Apriori-like search algorithm, (7) an approach for integrating pruning based on discreetized numerical attributes in an Apriori-like search algorithm, (8) an experimental evaluation of the various pruning methods (namely, optimum estimates, Apriori-like pruning, use of structure in attributes for pruning), (9) the application of the approach for data mining in a real-world financial database, and extensive comparisons with related work. The experiments provide a comparison of different methods for pruning the search space for subgroup discovery in an ILP framework. Optimum estimates and Apriori-like pruning have produced good and reliable pruning effects, while the effect of pruning based on structured attributes varied for different search settings. In particular, the experiments have shown that Apriori-like pruning can have a similarly good effect for search in a multi-relational data base as it has for search in a single-relation database. The application of the approach for data mining in a real-world financial database has shown that the language bias is well suited for the task of relational subgroup discovery, and that its expressivity is practically useful.
