Christians take the view that consciousness survives the death of the brain, but both groups tend to take the view that the origins of consciousness are linear, meaning that consciousness arises with the physical body and the travels on a straight time line for either a finitely or an infinitely long period (scientists say finite, Christians say infinite). With reference to the research coming out of the University iof Virginia since 1960, we present reasons to believe that consciousness actually has a non-linear origin. On this view, both science and orthodox Christianity are wrong: consciousness, on this view pre-exists the physical body in a realm that is infinite, not in the sense of being interminably long, but in the sense of transcending time (eternal). This consciousness is able from the evidence to periodically enter and exit the linear temporal realm of our everyday experience like a person entering and exiting a room."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7235702.V1": {"title": "Etika Bisnis Dalam Pandangan Islam", "description": "Business Ethics in Islam view gives an overview of its own. it is due to that the science of ethics in view of Islam explained about the values and truths based on the Al-Quran and Hadith.

It has the advantage that the group members can learn from each other and that, at the end, often a consensus emerges that everybody endorses. But a deliberation procedure also has a number of disadvantages. E.g., what consensus is reached usually depends on the order in which the different group members speak. More specifically, the group member who speaks first often has an unproportionally high impact on the final decision: She anchors the deliberation process. While the anchoring effect undoubtably appears in real deliberating groups, we ask whether it also appears in groups whose members are truth-seeking and rational in the sense that they take the information provided by their fellow group members properly into account by updating their beliefs according to plausible rules. To answer this question and to make some progress towards explaining the anchoring effect, a formal model is constructed and analyzed. Using this model, we study the anchoring effect in homogenous groups (i.e. groups whose members consider each other as equally reliable), for which we provide analytical results, and in inhomogeneous groups, for which we provide simulation results."}, "10.18452/15558": {"title": "Politik als Naturlehre", "description": "With its specific interest in the organology metaphor this study creates a new way of understanding political ideas of the first half of the 19th century. It points out that the comparision of state and society with a living body is not only a stylistic pattern but a collectively shared fundamental mentality that influenced the political philosophy of the beginning modern age. This is shown by a synchronic analysis of essential and fundamental texts of the six important political movements of the first half of the 19th century - Communism, the democratic and the women''s movement, Liberalism, Conservatism and the political Catholicism. All political philosophies use the demiurgic power of the organology metaphor to design world, state and society in a way that they appear as organisms, which are propelled in their development by hardly influencable natural powers. Likewise all philosophies mould the organisation of state and society according to the pattern of a living organism, in which the whole body and its parts mutually depend on each other. By supposing different natural forces working in men and women also the sexes are positioned differently in the collective body. This study first presents these common uses of the organology metaphor through all political movements and the fundamental mentality of the beginning modern age shown by these. After that it focusses on the specific uses of the organology metaphor and their implications in each text."}, "10.17877/DE290R-8954": {"title": "Die besten Nebenrollen", "description": "Originaltext vom Verlag; nicht vom SfBS bearbeitet."}, "10.5282/UBM/EPUB.28922": {"title": "Orthodox Position", "description": "In the Christian life of Finland, you can quite clearly notice the influence of both the eastern and the western heritage.

The problem is not insuperable: The argument must be run, not with the extensionalistic notion of reference (as in Wright's version), but with intensions. Furthermore, the argument should have a transcendental form; it should exclusively rely on conditions that are needed by the skeptic for formulating her own position."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5368411": {"title": "Pharma coding final.docx", "description": "Characterizing the interaction between physicians, pharmacists and pharmaceutical representatives in a middle-income country: A qualitative study"}, "10.5282/UBM/EPUB.12410": {"title": "A Plea for Randomness", "description": "This is a paper in the philosophy of education.
