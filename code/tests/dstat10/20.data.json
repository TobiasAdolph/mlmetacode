A true obsession in the medieval times, the putrid body would reappear as an aesthetic object in the horror literature, also known as \"gothic\". The so called roman-charogne, literary style that abuses of macabre references, outstands within this production, exploring aspects of the decaying corpse as never seen before. This article aims to point out these examples, problematizing the presence of the rotten dead body that would answer specific demands of those times."}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7706480": {"title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FEATURE SELECTION METHODS", "description": "Text analysis has been attracting increasing attention in this data era. Selecting effective features from datasets is a particular important part in text classification studies. Feature selection excludes irrelevant features from the classification task, reduces the dimensionality of a dataset, and improves the accuracy and performance of identification. So far, so many feature selection methods have been proposed, however, it remains unclear which method is the most effective in practice. This article focuses on evaluating and comparing the available feature selection methods in general versatility regarding authorship attribution problems and tries to identify which method is the most effective. The discussions on general versatility of feature selection methods and its connection in selecting the appropriate features for varying data were done. In addition, different languages, different types of features, different systems for calculating the accuracy of SVM (support vector machine), and different criteria for determining the rank of feature selection methods were used to measure the general versatility of these methods together. The analysis results indicate the best feature selection method is different for each dataset; however, some methods can always extract useful information to discriminate the classes. The chi-square was proved to be a better method overall."}, "10.1184/R1/6490289": {"title": "Empty Ceremony", "description": "In the summer before I entered college, Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his commencement address at Harvard accused American culture of obsessive materialism and a total lack of spirituality.

The present thesis examines the impact of focus particles and intonational focus on the mental representation of alternatives. In particular, it explores the linguistic and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the establishment of alternative sets in a series of psycholinguistic experiments. Two delayed recall experiments (Exp. 1a and 1b) revealed that participants were better at recalling mentioned alternatives to a focused element when the discourse contained the particles only or even. Experiments 2 and 3 found interference effects of focus particles in the recognition of mentioned alternatives and the rejection of unmentioned alternatives. An additional analysis and Experiment 4 indicate that the set of alternatives consists of various possible replacements of the focused element. Experiment 5 showed that contrastive accents facilitated the retrieval of alternatives while focus particles caused interference effects relative to the condition with an L+H* accent. Overall, this thesis indicates that intonational focus activates alternatives in the listeners mind and helps identifying relevant alternatives. Focus particles, on the other hand, cause stronger competition between the focused element and its alternatives."}, "10.17028/RD.LBORO.7376633": {"title": "Emergency water supply tank - Red Cross", "description": "Emergency water supply tank - Red Cross"}, "10.15496/publikation-10121": {"title": "Ancestry sampling for Indo-European phylogeny and dates", "description": "The date of the root of the Indo-European language family received much attention due to the application of Bayesian phylogenetic methods since the beginning of the last decade.

In this paper, I compare two dating techniques known as node-dating and total evidence dating for the Indo-European language family. I find that the total evidence dating based on a birth death tree infers age which is consistent with the Steppe hypothesis of spread of Indo-European languages."}}
