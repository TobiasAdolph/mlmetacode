The availability of sufficient amounts of energy is due to fundamental importance for the development of our society. Besides the demand on economical energy maintenance there are intensively occuring ecological and supply-technical aspects, whose importance advances permanently with the exponential increase of the energy consumption. This report presents the attempt of a holistic analysis for the system man - energy - environment regarding economical, ecological and technical aspects. The aim is to comprehend all significant influence factors and interactions as weIl as to compare and to evaluate the positive and negative effects of an increasing energy consumption and its protection by alternative energy supply systems. For such complex systems new methods developed in the field of system-engineering, specially cybernetic simulation, have to be used for the derivation of adequate aid for decision."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.5165839.v1": {"title": "Witchcraft and Evil Eye Beliefs", "description": "The graph displays national shares of witchcraft and evil eye beliefs based on nationally representative survey data by the PEW FORUM collected in 2009 - 2014"}, "10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.7054400": {"title": "Dissemination, video documentary", "description": "Watch the countdown."}, "10.6084/m9.figshare.6265247": {"title": "The Effect of Asset Sustainable Livelihood to Development of Central Agriculture City", "description": "This paper studied the influence of asset sustainable livelihood either direct or indirect due to development of agriculture city. Location of study was at Batu city as one of central agriculture city, East Java Province of Indonesia. Batu was well known either as tourism city or center agriculture city. As center agriculture city was supported by the natural and environmental condition, and public social condition mainly by functioning agricultural area. The methodology consisted of interview, documentation, observation and field survey, collecting secondary data, and then analysis data. Results used as the consideration in the effort of developing center agriculture based on livelihood sustainable approach Otherwise, agricultural business men could develop their business wisely by using the facilities like: the input was agricultural structure; agricultural plantation was on farm, and producing agricultural results as agroindustry."}, "10.18452/3748": {"title": "A Nonparametric Test for the Stationary Density", "description": "We propose a nonparametric test for checking parametric hypotheses about the stationary density of weakly dependent observations. The test statistic is based on the L2-distance between a nonparametric and a smoothed version of a parametric estimate of the stationary density. It can be shown that this statistic behaves asymptotically as in the case of independent observations. Accordingly, we propose an i.i.d.-type bootstrap to determine the critical value for the test."}, "10.5282/UBM/EPUB.13479": {"title": "Regret in Dynamic Decision Problems", "description": "The paper proposes a framework to extend regret theory to dynamic contexts. The key idea is to conceive of a dynamic decision problem with regret as an intra-personal game in which the agent forms conjectures about the behaviour of the various counterfactual selves that he could have been. We derive behavioural implications in situations in which payoffs are correlated across either time or contingencies. In the first case, regret might lead to excess conservatism or a tendency to make up for missed opportunities. In the second case, behaviour is shaped by the agent\u2019s self-conception. We relate our results to empirical evidence."}, "10.18452/3955": {"title": "Macroeconomic Regime Switches and Speculative Attacks", "description": "This paper explains a currency crisis as an outcome of a switch in how monetary policy and fiscal policy are coordinated. The paper develops a model of an open economy in which monetary policy starts active, fiscal policy starts passive and, in a particular state of nature, monetary policy switches to passive and fiscal policy switches to active. The probability of the regime switch is endogenous and changes over time together with the state of the economy. The regime switch is preceded by a sharp increase in interest rates and causes a jump in the exchange rate. The model predicts that currency composition of public debt affects dynamics of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, the model is consistent with evidence from recent currency crises, in particular small seigniorage revenues."}, "10.5282/UBM/EPUB.13407": {"title": "When queueing is better than push and shove", "description": "We address the scheduling problem of reordering an existing queue into its efficient order through trade. To that end, we consider individually rational and balanced budget direct and indirect mechanisms. We show that this class of mechanisms allows us to form efficient queues provided that existing property rights for the service are small enough to enable trade between the agents. In particular, we show on the one hand that no queue under a fully deterministic service schedule such as first-come, first-serve can be dissolved efficiently and meet our requirements. If, on the other hand, the alternative is service anarchy (ie. a random queue), every existing queue can be transformed into an efficient order."}, "10.5282/UBM/EPUB.21265": {"title": "Political Booms, Financial Crises", "description": "We show that political booms, measured by the rise in governments\u2019 popularity, predict financial crises above and beyond other better-known early warning indicators, such as credit booms. This predictive power, however, only holds in emerging economies. We show that governments in emerging economies are more concerned about their reputation and tend to ride the short-term popularity benefits of weak credit booms rather than implementing politically costly corrective policies that would help prevent potential crises. We provide evidence of the relevance of this reputation mechanism."}, "10.18419/opus-8340": {"title": "Verbraucherpolitik", "description": "-"}}
